# 1. About HackerRankSolutions
HackerRankSolutions is a collection of all solutions I've written so far for [HackerRank][hr] problems. I've used Java. My goal was to write code which is:
* correct
* fast enough to pass all test cases
* readable, unlike most of the solutions to this type of programming problems
